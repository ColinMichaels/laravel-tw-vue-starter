## Inspiration



## Usage

The concept here is for me to practice PHPSpec , VueJs , Laravel, Tailwind , and learning Inertia.   
I started this building out classes in PHP using PHPspec.  I am going to continue working on that end but wanted something visually happening so I jumped ahead a bit and starting implementing Inertia.js (used alot of the Inertia.js demo project PingCRM to get me up to speed) _Thank you Jonathan Reinink @Reinink_ for all your hard work there.   Also want to give a shout out to the man the myth, the legend Jeffery Way @laracast.  Without his videos and hard work I would have never been able to do any of this.
