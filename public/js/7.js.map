Each player is dealt five cards face down, after which there is a betting round. Players are required to open with a bet or fold. The players who remain in the pot after the first betting round now have an option to improve their hands by replacing cards in their hands with new ones. This is the draw. The game is normally played with one or more blinds, sometimes with an ante added. Some betting structures allow the big blind to be called; other structures require the minimum open to be double the big blind. In limit poker, the usual structure has the limit double after the draw (Northern California is an exception.) The most popular forms of lowball are ace-to-five lowball (also known as California lowball), and deuce-to-seven lowball (also known as Kansas City lowball). Ace-to-five lowball gets its name because the best hand at that form is 5-4-3-2-A. Deuce-to-seven lowball gets its name because the best hand at that form is 7-5-4-3-2 (not of the same suit).

Each player is dealt five cards face down, after which there is a betting round. Players are required to open with a bet or fold. The players who remain in the pot after the first betting round now have an option to improve their hands by replacing cards in their hands with new ones. This is the draw. The game is normally played with one or more blinds, sometimes with an ante added. Some betting structures allow the big blind to be called; other structures require the minimum open to be double the big blind. In limit poker, the usual structure has the limit double after the draw (Northern California is an exception.) The most popular forms of lowball are ace-to-five lowball (also known as California lowball), and deuce-to-seven lowball (also known as Kansas City lowball). Ace-to-five lowball gets its name because the best hand at that form is 5-4-3-2-A. Deuce-to-seven lowball gets its name because the best hand at that form is 7-5-4-3-2 (not of the same suit). For a further description of the forms of lowball, see the individual section for each game.

Before the draw, if a player has fewer than five cards in his hand, he can receive additional cards, provided no action has been taken by the first player to act (unless that action occurs before the deal is completed). However, the dealer position can still receive a missing fifth card, even if action has taken place. If action has been taken, a player with fewer than five cards is entitled on the draw to receive the number of cards necessary to complete a five-card hand.</li>\n                    <li>A player can change the number of cards he wishes to draw, provided:</li>\n                    <ul style=\"list-style:lower-alpha; margin-left: 20px\">\n                        <li>No card has been dealt off the deck in response to his request (including the burncard).</li>\n                        <li>No player has acted, in either the betting or indicating the number of cards to be drawn, based on the number of cards the player has requested.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <li>If a player is asked by another active player how many cards he drew the player is obligated to respond until there has been action after the draw, and the dealer is also obligated to respond. Once there is any action after the draw, the player is no longer obliged to respond and the dealer must not respond.</li>\n                    <li>Rapping the table in turn constitutes either a pass or the declaration of a pat hand that does not want to draw any cards, depending on the situation.</li>\n                    <li>Cards speak (cards read for themselves). However, a player is not allowed to claim a better hand than he holds. (Example: If a player declares \"8\", that player must produce at least an 8 low or better to win. But if a player erroneously calls the second card incorrectly, such as \"8-6\" when actually holding an 8-7, no penalty applies.) If a player miscalls his hand and causes another player to foul his hand, the hand of the player who misdeclared is dead. If both hands remain intact, the best hand wins. If a miscalled hand occurs in a multihanded pot, the miscalled hand is dead, and the best remaining hand wins the pot. For your own protection, always hold your hand until you see your opponent's cards.</li>\n                    <li>Any player spreading a hand with a pair in it must announce \"pair\" or risk losing the pot if it causes any other player to foul a hand.

If a player checks a 7 or better and it is the best hand, all action after the draw is void, and the player cannot win any money on any subsequent bets. The player is still eligible to win whatever existed in the pot before the draw if he has the best hand. If a player checks a 7 or better and the hand is beaten, he loses the pot and any additional calls he makes. If there is an all-in bet after the draw that is less than half a bet, a 7 or better can just call and win that bet. However, if another player overcalls this short bet and loses, the person who overcalls receives the bet back. If the seven or better completes to a full bet, this fulfills all obligations.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <strong>Deuce-to-Seven Lowball</strong>\n                <br>\n                <br>\n                In deuce-to-seven lowball (sometimes known as Kansas City lowball), in most respects, the worst conventional poker hand wins. Straights and flushes count against a player, crippling the value of a hand. The ace is used only as a high card. Therefore, the best hand is 7-5-4-3-2, not all of the same suit. The hand 5-4-3-2-A is not considered to be a straight, but an A-5 high, so it beats other ace-high hands and pairs, but loses to king-high. A pair of aces is the highest pair, so it loses to any other pair. The rules for deuce-to-seven lowball are the same as those for ace-to-five lowball, except for the following differences:\n                <br>\n                <br>\n                <ul class=\"numbered\">\n                    <li>The best hand is 7-5-4-3-2 of at least two different suits.
